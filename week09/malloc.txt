Function malloc()
void* malloc(size_t size);
Allocate memory block
Allocate a block of size bytes of memory, returning a pointer to the beginning of the block. The content of the newly allocated block of memory is not initialized, remaining with indeterminate values.
If size is zero, the return value depends on the particular library implementation (it may or may not ber a null pointer), but the returned pointer shall not be dereferenced.
